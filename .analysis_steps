Planned steps:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
2. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to generate freezed/json serialization files.
3. Re-run `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` and fix remaining issues.
4. If generation fails, create minimal stubs for missing generated files (VehicleEntity etc).
5. Re-run analyze and report.
